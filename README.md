# CS305-Software-Security


# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial was a financial consulting company that provided indidualized financial plans to its customers. They needed a website to deliver information to their customers in a secure way and they wanted us to help with securing their web application.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I believe I did a good job at using resources available for performing static testing on dependencies and identifying vulnerabilities related to those dependencies.
   
# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The most challenging part of working through the vulnerability assessment was identifying false positives recorded by our static testing tools. In order to safely say that something was a false positive, I needed to verify that the issue identified didn't actually play a role in the software.
    
# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

In the future, I will rely on code reviews and static testing tools to help assess vulnerabilities.

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ensured the code was functional and secure by building the programs, running dependency checks, and reviewing the code to identify any vulnerabilities that I could. I reran the static tests after refactoring the code to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.
    
# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The OWASP dependency check tool was helpful in my work and I can see myself using that in the future to help identify potential vulnerabilities.
    
# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

From this class, I would want to showcase my ability to analyze information to determine the most appropriate encryption algorithms for a given task along with my ability to listen to a clients needs to address all of their concerns. From this assignment, I would want to showcase my ability to create simple web applications using the spring framework, my ability to secure the application through https, and my ability to implement file verification techniques to help ensure secure communications.
